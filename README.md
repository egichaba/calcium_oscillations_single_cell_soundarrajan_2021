# Calcium Oscillations in a Single Cell Model Soundarrajan 2021

This repository contains the Python code to simulate the calcium oscillations for a single cell model reported in the manuscript  "7.	Soundarrajan, D., Huizar, F. J., Paravitorghabeh, R., Robinett, T., & Zartman, J. J. (2021). From spikes to intercellular waves: Tuning intercellular calcium signaling dynamics modulates organ size control. PLOS Computational Biology, 17(11), e1009543. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009543". The code was built by [Emmanuel M. Gichaba](www.linkedin.com/in/emmanuel-gichaba-6b3289187), [Dr. Norma C
